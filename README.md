✅ Persistent Notes: Notes are stored in a notes.json file, allowing them to remain saved even after the server restarts.

🔁 Automatic Load & Save: On server startup, notes are loaded from the file. When a new note is added (formatted by a Java program), it’s automatically saved back to the file.

The backend is built using Node.js + Express, the frontend uses HTML + JavaScript, and note formatting is handled via a Java class, showcasing integration across technologies.
